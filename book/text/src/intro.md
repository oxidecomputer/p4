# The x4c Book

This book provides an introduction to the P4 language using the `x4c` compiler.
The presentation is by example. Each concept is introduced through example P4
code and programs - then demonstrated using simple harnesses that pass packets
through compiled P4 pipelines.

A basic knowledge of programming and networking is assumed. The `x4c` Rust
compilation target will be used in this book, so a working knowledge of
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is also good to have.
