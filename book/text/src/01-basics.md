# The Basics

This chapter will take you from zero to a simple hello-world program in P4.
This will include.

- Getting a Rust toolchain setup and installing the `x4c` compiler.
- Compiling a P4 hello world program into a Rust program.
- Writing a bit of Rust code to push packets through the our compiled P4
  pipelines.
